The "every X seconds" trick is [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/406534637242810369/406554085794381833/663639878453559316).

## Display only the current workspace

This can with `:ui modeline` enabled in `init.el`, by adding the following to `config.el`

```lisp
(setq doom-modeline-persp-name t)
```
