# Nix derivation dependency graph

I recently had to debug [a problem](https://github.com/srid/neuron/issues/193) wherein a Haskell binary created using Nix was created with a runtime dependency on the entire GHC ecosystem (despite using `justStaticExecutables`). This investigation led to identifying Cabal's `Paths_*` module autogeneration as the root cause.

The following commands came in handy when investigating the problem, which was fixed (as a workaround) using `remove-references-to`.

## Useful commands

* Get the dependency tree:
   ```bash
   nix-store -q --tree result
   ```
* Ask "why" as to a particular dependency:
   ```bash
   nix why-depends -a ./result \
    /nix/store/bicv5nnibqg0qsqyjvb3nw01447yms0j-shake-0.18.5-data
   ```
* Remove reference to a dependency manually using [`remove-references-to`](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/master/pkgs/build-support/remove-references-to/default.nix). 

## Cleaning up after Cabal using `remove-references-to`

Some examples:
