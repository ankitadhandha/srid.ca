title: "Enable ormolu only on certain projects"
date: 2020-04-15

The documentation for `ormolu-format-on-save` says:

```lisp
To enable it in specific files or directories,
use the local variables "mode" mechanism, e.g. in ".dir-locals.el" you
might use:

     ((some-major-mode
        (mode . ormolu-format-on-save)))
```

As ormolu works with Haskell sources, that "some-major-mode" has to be haskell-mode, so create a file named `.dir-locals.el` in the project root directory containing:

```lisp
((haskell-mode
  (mode . ormolu-format-on-save)))
```

For now, I just have to manually format using [SPC m f](kbd:)
