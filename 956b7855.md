To focus on writing your content only, Emacs provides a few packages. 

* [`darkroom`](https://github.com/joaotavora/darkroom)
* [`writeroom-mode`](https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode)

In Doom Emacs you can use [the `ui/zen`
module](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/develop/modules/ui/zen/README.org)
which, as of this writing, uses `writeroom-mode`.
